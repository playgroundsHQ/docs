# Playspec

A **Playspec** is a blueprint that defines the structure of your development environment. It wraps a Docker Compose file, classifies each service, and enriches it with platform-specific configuration like routing, IDE integration, and source code mounting.

## Overview

Think of a Playspec as a **reusable template** for environments. You define it once, and then launch as many [Playgrounds](/core-concepts/playground) from it as you need — each Playground is an independent, running instance of the same Playspec.

## Configuration

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | A human-readable label for this Playspec |
| **Description** | Optional description (up to 1000 characters) |
| **Docker Compose YAML** | The base `docker-compose.yml` defining your services |
| **Services** | Classified list of services (see below) |
| **Persist Volumes** | Whether to preserve Docker volumes across Playground recreations |

## Docker Compose Definition

Every Playspec starts with a standard Docker Compose YAML. You can:

- **Write it manually** in the built-in YAML editor
- **Load it from a Playzone** — If your repository contains a `docker-compose.yml`, the platform auto-detects and imports it
- **Import from a template** — Use a pre-built template from [Stargate](/launch/stargate) or [My Fleet](/launch/my-fleet)

The platform parses and validates the Compose file, extracting service definitions, ports, and other configuration.

## Service Classification

After providing a Compose YAML, you must classify each service as either **static** or **dynamic**:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Static** | A standard Docker container that runs a pre-built image. No source code mounting, no IDE. | PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch |
| **Dynamic** | A source-code-backed service. Supports Dev mode (live editing) and Production mode (built image). | Your web app, API server, worker |

### Dynamic Service Configuration

Each dynamic service requires additional configuration:

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Playzone** | Which GitHub repository provides the source code | — |
| **Dockerfile Path** | Path to the Dockerfile within the repository | `Dockerfile` |
| **Env File Path** | Path to the `.env.example` file for default environment variables | `.env.example` |
| **Working Directory** | Container working directory where source code is mounted | `/app` |

### Static Service Configuration

Static services only require an **image** name (e.g., `postgres:16`, `redis:7`).

## Service Exposure

Each service can be exposed to the network with the following settings:

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Enabled** | Whether the service is HTTP-accessible | `false` |
| **Port** | The container port to expose | `80` |
| **Subdomain** | The subdomain prefix for the service URL | Service name |
| **Visibility** | Access control level | `internal` |

### Visibility Options

| Visibility | Behaviour |
|------------|-----------|
| **External** | Publicly accessible — anyone with the URL can access the service |
| **Internal** | Protected by HTTP Basic Auth — requires the Playground's username and password |

:::tip Subdomain Naming
Subdomains are defined on the Playspec level as defaults, but can be **overridden per Playground**. This allows multiple Playgrounds from the same Playspec to coexist on the same Playroom without subdomain conflicts.

## Mounted Files

You can attach up to **3 files** (maximum **2 MB each**) to a Playspec. These files are synced to the remote host and mounted into specified services. Common use cases:

- Configuration files (e.g., `nginx.conf`, `.env.production`)
- SSL certificates
- Seed data files

Each mounted file is configured with:
- **Mount path** — Absolute path inside the container
- **Target services** — Which services receive the mount
- **Read-only** — Whether the mount is read-only (default: yes)

## Registry Credentials

If your services use images from private Docker registries, you can add registry credentials to the Playspec. The platform uses these credentials to authenticate `docker pull` operations on the Playroom.

## Augmented Compose Template

When you save a Playspec, the platform generates an **augmented compose template** — an enriched version of your original Compose YAML that includes:

- Traefik routing labels for each exposed service
- Network configuration for service isolation and ingress
- Code-server sidecar definitions for dynamic services
- Volume mounts for source code
- Platform-specific environment variables

This template is used internally and is not directly editable. It is regenerated whenever you modify the Playspec's services.

## Locked Status

A Playspec becomes **locked** once any Playground references it. While locked:

- The Docker Compose YAML, services, mounted files, and registry credentials **cannot be modified**
- The name and description **can** still be updated
- The Playspec **cannot be deleted**

To unlock a Playspec, delete all Playgrounds that reference it.

## Statefulness

When **Persist Volumes** is enabled, the Playspec is considered **stateful**. This means:

- Docker volumes are preserved across Playground recreations
- Volume names are prefixed with `pv-{playspec_id}-{playroom_id}` for isolation
- Only one Playground per Playspec+Playroom combination can exist at a time (to prevent volume conflicts)

When disabled, volumes are destroyed and recreated with each Playground recreation.

## Resource Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Maximum Playspecs per account | **1,000** |
| Maximum mounted files per Playspec | **3** |
| Maximum file size | **2 MB** per file |
