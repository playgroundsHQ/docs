# Bridge

The **Bridge** is the central management hub for all your AI genies. It provides a unified, full-screen interface where you can quickly switch between active genie chats, monitor their status, and manage their lifecycle across all your [Playrooms](/core-concepts/playroom).

## Key Features

### 1. Unified Genie Sidebar
The left sidebar lists all your registered genies. You can see their current status at a glance:
- **Authenticated:** Ready for chat or attachment to Playgrounds.
- **Pending:** Requires credential setup.
- **Active Chat:** Indicates an genie currently running a standalone chat session.

### 2. Instant Tab Switching
The Bridge uses a high-performance client-side switching mechanism. When you click on an genie, the interface updates instantly without a full page reload or iframe flicker, allowing you to jump between different AI assistants seamlessly.

### 3. Real-time Status & Reachability
The Bridge continuously monitors the health of your genie containers.
- **SSL Verification:** If a chat is deploying, the Bridge checks if the SSL certificate is ready before letting you in.
- **Automatic Retries:** If a connection is temporarily lost, the Bridge attempts to reconnect and updates the UI status in real-time.

### 4. Direct Terminal & Logs
Access advanced developer tools directly from the Bridge:
- **View Logs:** Stream live container logs to debug genie behavior or provider connection issues.
- **Debug Terminal:** Open a web-based shell into the genie sidecar for deep inspection.

## Standalone Chat Lifecycle

Through the Bridge, you can launch genies on any active Playroom without creating a full Playground.

1. **Launch:** Pick an genie and a destination Playroom.
2. **Interact:** Chat with the genie via its own unique subdomain.
3. **Extend:** Standalone chats have a default TTL (typically 2 hours). You can extend this or set it to **Never Expire**.
4. **Purge:** Use the "Purge" action to completely wipe the genie's remote environment and start fresh.

## Genie Mutters (Internal Reasoning)

Modern AI genies often perform complex reasoning before producing a response. The Bridge exposes these "Mutters" (internal thoughts) in a dedicated panel, giving you transparency into the genie's decision-making process.

- **Traceable logic:** See exactly how the genie is approaching your task.
- **Debugging:** Identify where an genie might be getting stuck or misinterpreting instructions.
