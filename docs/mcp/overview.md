# MCP Server

Playgrounds.dev includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server. Any MCP-compatible AI agent or client can connect to the MCP server and manage the entire platform using natural language.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create an API Key

Create an API key with the `mcp:access` scope **plus** all resource scopes you want the agent to use:

Navigate to **Profile → API Keys** in the web UI, or use the API:

```bash
POST /api/keys
{
  "api_key": {
    "label": "MCP Agent Key",
    "scopes": [
      "mcp:access",
      "playrooms:read", "playrooms:write",
      "playspecs:read", "playspecs:write",
      "playgrounds:read", "playgrounds:write",
      "playzones:read", "playzones:write",
      "repos:write",
      "launch:write",
      "import_templates:read", "import_templates:write"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Configure Your AI Client

Add the following to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playgrounds-dev": {
      "url": "https://my.playgrounds.dev/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Start Using It

Ask your AI agent things like:

> "List my playrooms and show which ones are active"

> "Create a playspec with a Rails app, PostgreSQL, and Redis"

> "Launch a playground from my web-stack playspec on playroom 1"

The agent will use the appropriate MCP tools to carry out your request.

## Endpoint

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/mcp` | Send JSON-RPC 2.0 messages |
| `GET` | `/mcp/sse` | SSE stream (legacy transport) |
| `DELETE` | `/mcp` | Terminate session |

The server supports both the **Streamable HTTP** transport (recommended) and the legacy **SSE** transport.

## Authentication

- **Method:** Bearer token in the `Authorization` header
- **Required scope:** `mcp:access` on the API key
- **Per-tool scopes:** Each tool additionally checks resource-specific scopes (e.g., `playgrounds:write`)

All standard [API authentication](/api/overview) rules apply. An API key without `mcp:access` will be rejected with a `403 Forbidden` error.

:::info Destructive Tools

:::

## Available Resources

Resources provide contextual information that AI agents can read:

| Resource | URI | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Player Profile | `playgrounds://player/profile` | Your account info |
| Player Quotas | `playgrounds://player/quotas` | Resource quotas and current usage |
| API Scopes | `playgrounds://api/scopes` | Available and current key scopes |

## Security

- All requests require a valid Bearer token with `mcp:access` scope
- Each tool enforces resource-specific scopes (same as the REST API)
- Ownership rules are enforced — you can only manage your own resources
- Destructive tools are annotated with `destructiveHint: true`
- Read-only tools are annotated with `readOnlyHint: true`

## Testing with MCP Inspector

You can test the MCP server locally using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/misc/mcp_inspector):

```bash
npx @anthropic-ai/mcp-inspector
```

Configure with your instance URL (e.g., `https://my.playgrounds.dev/mcp`) and Bearer token.
