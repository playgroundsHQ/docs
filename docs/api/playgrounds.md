          "create_branch": false
        },
        "production": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| `service_subdomains` | Per-service subdomain overrides |
| `services.{name}.git_config.branch_name` | Branch to use for a dynamic service |
| `services.{name}.git_config.create_branch` | Create a new branch from `base_branch_name` |
| `services.{name}.git_config.base_branch_name` | Base branch when creating a new branch |
| `services.{name}.production` | Run this service in production mode |

---

### Destroy Playground

```bash
DELETE /api/playgrounds/:id
```

Destroys all containers and resources. Returns `204 No Content`.

---

### Recreate Playground

```bash
POST /api/playgrounds/:id/recreate
```

Destroys containers and re-runs the full provisioning pipeline. Preserves volumes if the Playspec has `persist_volumes` enabled.

---

### Restart Playground

```bash
POST /api/playgrounds/:id/restart
```

Performs an in-place restart of the Playground's containers without destroying the environment. The platform pre-pulls and pre-builds all required Docker images **before** bringing containers down, minimizing downtime. Returns `202 Accepted`.

**Restart vs Recreate:**

| | Restart | Recreate |
|---|---|---|
| Downtime | Minimal (pre-pull first) | Full reprovision cycle |
| Volumes | Always preserved | Preserved only if `persist_volumes` enabled |
| Config changes | Not applied | Applied |
| Use case | Recover stuck services | Apply spec changes |

---

### Extend Expiration

```bash
POST /api/playgrounds/:id/extend_expiration
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `duration_hours` | integer | Hours to extend by (default: 8) |

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "expires_at": "2025-01-16T02:30:00Z",
  "time_remaining": 57600.0
}
```

---

### Get Generated Compose

```bash
GET /api/playgrounds/:id/compose
```

Returns the final Docker Compose YAML generated by the platform:

```json
{
  "compose_yaml": "services:\n  web:\n    ...",
  "compose_project": "pg-1-feature-auth"
}
```

---

### Get Service Logs

```bash
GET /api/playgrounds/:id/logs/:service?tail=100
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `tail` | integer | `100` | Number of lines to return (max: 1000) |

**Response:**

```json
{
  "service": "web",
  "lines": [
    "=> Booting Puma",
    "=> Rails 8.0.0 application starting in development",
    "* Listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000"
  ],
  "source": "live"
}
```

For completed job-mode Playgrounds, logs are returned from cache (`"source": "cached"`).

---

### Get Environment Metadata

```bash
GET /api/playgrounds/:id/env_metadata
```

Returns the fully merged environment variables with source tracking:

}
```

### Get Debug Info

```bash
GET /api/playgrounds/:id/debug
```

Returns comprehensive diagnostic information including the generated Compose YAML, augmented template, service configuration, build records, and branch clone details — useful for troubleshooting deployment issues.

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "compose_project": "pg-1-feature-auth",
  "generated_compose_yaml": "services:\n  web:\n    ...",
  "augmented_compose_template": "...",
